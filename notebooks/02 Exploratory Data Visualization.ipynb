    "Taking the previous notebookâ€™s vetted Divvy bike share dataset, we will now use, cuDF, cuxfilter, and cuGraph to quickly create cross-filtered visualizations to explore different perspectives and slices of the data in search of interesting patterns. \n",
    "\n",
    "### cuxfilter and cuGraph\n",
    "- [cuDF](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cudf/stable/) is a RAPIDS GPU DataFrame library for manipulating data with a pandas-like API.\n",
    "\n",
    "- [cuxfilter](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuxfilter/nightly/) is a RAPIDS viz project. Focused around cross-filtering data, its designed to quickly build linked dashboards powered by cuDF compute capabilities. Cuxfilter acts as a connector library rather than a visualization library. It abstracts away all the 'plumbing' required to connect a [curated list of visualizations](https://docs.rapids.ai/api/cuxfilter/nightly/charts/charts.html) to a GPU dataframe. By simply enabling accelerated dashboards inline within a notebook workflow, cuxfilter allows analysts to get to exploring their data faster.\n",
